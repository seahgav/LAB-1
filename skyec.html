      A Radiant from Nimbin, Australia, Kirra Foster spent years fighting against Kingdom Corporation's ventures in Eastern Australia.

Later approached by the VALORANT Protocol to become an agent, Foster was initially unsure of joining as she didn't want to give up her fight against Kingdom and leave her homeland unprotected. However, when Sage decided to contact and direct her to a massive rift in the sky near her home, telling her there were many more like that one across the world, Kirra realized that the fight was bigger than just her home territory. Finally answering the call, she now serves as the Protocol's fourteenth agent, "Skye".
