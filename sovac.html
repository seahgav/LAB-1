      Hailing from the town of Severomorsk, in Murmansk Oblast, Russia, Sasha Novikov is an archer who became an agent for the VALORANT Protocol as its sixth recruit, "Sova". With his right eye replaced with a mechanical one after he lost it, Sova primarily serves as the team's scout, gathering information and searching for targets using olden methods should technology come up short. Being highly capable and reliable both in the field and with his work, whilst also having experience with multiple radianite-related events (having traveled through a rift and having met his Omega counterpart), Sova has earned a reputation of being one of the Protocol's most trusted agents, especially to the organization's commander, Brimstone.
