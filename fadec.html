        A Radiant from Turkey, Hazal Eyletmez searches for a person of importance to her after he was 'taken from her'. Using her ability to see nightmare-visions, her interpretations initially led her to suspect that he had been kidnapped by a secret organization she found to be the VALORANT Protocol. Eyletmez decided to contact the Protocol under an anonymous mark, threatening to expose the organization if she found out they were responsible for the kidnapping. When they appeared to only have interest in tracking her down rather than take her seriously, she then contacted each agent personally with a dossier about them to show how much she knew about VALORANT's people and what she could expose to the public if they had no interest in proving their innocence. VALORANT however still refused to give in and soon sent a strike team to Istanbul to apprehend her. Eyletmez attempted to use her Radiant powers to distract them and flee undetected but was spotted just as she was making her escape, allowing the Anti-Yield robot KAY/O to jump on her position and take her down with a suppressing pulse. Subsequently detained and taken to a VP base, Eyletmez was interrogated there by senior agents. However, it was because of these direct, face-to-face meetings that a critical piece of information came to light - VALORANT had no idea who she was trying to track down and knew nothing of any kidnapping. Whoever was responsible for the man's disappearance, it wasn't the VALORANT Protocol.
