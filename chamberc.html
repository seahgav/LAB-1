        The Frenchman Vincent Fabron lives his life in search of one necessary goal, willing to sacrifice anything that gets in his way of achieving it. He has spent much of his time involved with combat and weapons, having worked for the French military before becoming a PMC marksman and then a weapons designer for Kingdom Defense. His employment at Kingdom was only a stepping stone for him though, as by this point he was already set on his path in pursuit of his sacred truth. One such event that exemplified Fabron's will to continue with his goals no matter the cost surrounds his actions at the Everett-Linde Research Facility in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he traveled to around 9 AFL and began communicating with employees there. Fabron soon found himself barred from entering facility grounds shortly after attempting to access their systems but eventually returned to reinstate his security clearance and obtain schematics. However, he was soon forced to make a decision that required him to destroy the facility's Large Radian Collider. Having already made contact with his Omega counterpart, together they fired on the LRC on the day the lab's people were celebrating its supposed success. The resulting explosion killed many of its employees and the facility was reduced to a husk.
