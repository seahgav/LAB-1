      Ling Ying Wei is a Radiant monk coming from China. Going on to become an agent for the VALORANT Protocol as its seventh recruit, "Sage", Ling was able to work her way quickly up the ranks, becoming the Protocol's second-in-command under Brimstone and over more veteran agents. Sage is currently active in VALORANT's radiant agent recruitment and training, interacting with multiple new radiants upon recruitment and taking the lead on its radiant training program.
