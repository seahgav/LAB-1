        Astra is an energetic and joyful agent who doesn't hold back what she wants to say. She is fairly straightforward when it comes to expressing herself and friendly banter is definitely her go-to style. She seems to have an affinity for liveliness, and doesn't like it when people and places have no 'color' or 'personality' to them.
        She has stated that her plans and ideas may sometimes sound irrational, but this is only because she can see what most cannot due to her cosmic powers.
