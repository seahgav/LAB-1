        Klara Böhringer is an inventor from Germany who was born to one parent with Germanic ancestry. A nominee for the Distinguished Inventor award, Böhringer became the lead for Kingdom's R&D department at the age of 18. Incredibly successful, she had many breakthroughs during her time at Kingdom with several of her creations and innovations.[1] Böhringer was the fourth agent to join the VALORANT Protocol as "Killjoy". She earned her call sign after her team initially used it to compliment her outstanding skills that reduced the amount of work the rest of them had to do, with Klara deciding to keep the nickname. Killjoy now continues her innovative work as an agent of VALORANT and the protégé of the organization's commander, Brimstone. From inventing spike defusers under pressure of an incoming detonation to building teleporters for transportation between worlds, any device the Protocol needs for any purpose - with the right tools, Killjoy can make it.
