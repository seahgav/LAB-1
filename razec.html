      Tayane Alves is an engineer coming from Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, with a strong enthusiasm for explosives and paint - usually combined. Holding strong objections towards Kingdom Corporation's operations in Bahia, Alves was involved in driving the company out of her home state and forcing them to abandon their sites there, the marks of her tools staining the plots as a testament to her victories. Hired since then to work for the VALORANT Protocol as its twelfth agent, "Raze", Alves now sows her chaos against bigger threats to Earth. However, as the paint fades from Salvador's walls, Raze cannot afford to leave her home completely behind, lest Kingdom look to make its return there.
