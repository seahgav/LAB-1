        A robot from an alternate future, KAY/O was created by the humans of that time to fight back against the radiants that they were at war with. Using the power of polarized radianite, KAY/O proved effective in shutting down radiants' abilities, making them easier to eliminate. The radiant Reyna was of particularly high importance to KAY/O for her actions against humanity, and KAY/O was able to eventually eliminate her. However, at this point humans had already suffered severe losses.[1] KAY/O would later on travel centuries back in time to the present day, arriving on an island near the Caribbean, and would soon be recruited as an agent of the VALORANT Protocol. He now fights as an agent in a time where there is harmony between humans and radiants, alongside alternate versions of both humans he served with and radiants he fought against. However, the scars from KAY/O's previous war remain, from the loses he endured and from the pain inflicted by versions of the same radiants he now finds himself working with.
