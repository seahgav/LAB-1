      Raised in Manila, Philippines, Tala Nicole Dimaapi Valdez is a Radiant empowered by her bioelectricity which has enlaced itself with Earth's radianite mesh. A young but former veteran at K/SEC, she was recruited by the VALORANT Protocol as part of their Omega Project, specifically to utilize her electric abilities as they attempted to power an Alpha-Omega teleporter. Accepting a position there as their nineteenth agent, "Neon", Valdez left her home to join the Protocol and now seeks to help establish a stable connection that will finally allow the VP to cross over to Omega Earth.
