        Hailing from the United States, Liam Byrne started his adult life as a firefighter for the BFD and then a military soldier for a Special Forces squad known as the Ragged Ravens. He served in both professions alongside a close friend who he had known since childhood. He also became affiliated with Kingdom Corporation, eventually becoming a veteran of their subsidiary K/SEC. After the events of First Light, the secretive VALORANT Protocol was founded, with Byrne being the first agent to join them and eventually becoming its leader and commander, "Brimstone". In recent years his position has left him with more of a back-line presence, but life behind a desk has never been of interest to Brimstone, and he'll make sure to still be present in the field from time to time.
